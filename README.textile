h1. DragonflyMongoidExtensions

h2. Install

This plugin makes Dragonfly works with Mongoid like it works with ActiveRecord

To install just do:

bc. script/plugin install git://github.com/wilkerlucio/dragonfly_mongoid_extensions.git

Then you will need to configure, to do it just generate dragonfly initializer like you do with ActiveRecord:

bc. script/generate dragonfly_app images

Open this file and edit the integration, the default should be something like this:

bc. # Extend ActiveRecord
# This allows you to use e.g.
#   other_accessor :my_attribute
# in your models.
ActiveRecord::Base.extend Dragonfly::ActiveRecordExtensions
ActiveRecord::Base.register_dragonfly_app(:image, Dragonfly::App[:images])

You should replace these lines with:

bc. # Plug Mongoid Extensions
Mongoid::Document::InstanceMethods.module_eval do
  def self.included(base)
    base.extend Dragonfly::MongoidExtensions::ClassMethods
    base.send :include, Dragonfly::MongoidExtensions::InstanceMethods
    base.register_dragonfly_app :image, Dragonfly::App[:images]
  end
end

Them you are ready to go!

h2. Example model

A sample model for you:

bc.. class User
  include Mongoid::Document
  
  field :name
  field :email
  
  image_accessor :avatar
end

p. Notice you dont need to declare @avatar_uid@ field, the extension will do it automatic for you.
